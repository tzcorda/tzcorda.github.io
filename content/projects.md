      text: <b>Authoritarianism and external actors in Africa</b>
      
      ​As part of my post-doc project on the external dimension of authoritarian resilience in Africa, I examine how extra-regional actors/factors influence the domestic politics and policies of autocratic regimes in Africa. This consists in comparing how various forms of engagement between external actors and African regimes affect specific components of African regimes’ authoritarian resilience and/or resurgence, focusing not only on the duration of local leaderships but also on the status of a set of political rights and civil liberties and the likelihood of autocratization attempts (coups and term limits violations). 
      
      <b>Sanctions, primarily in Africa and by its regional organizations</b>
      
      In my PhD research I examined international sanctions and the domestic institutional constraints shaping sanctions effectiveness. Focusing on the African continent, I am now developing a new dataset (and related research) on sanctions in Africa, which includes measures imposed both by regional and extra-regional actors. Under this project, I am also going back to the original black-knights sanctions literature to reassess the effects of third parties' sanction-busting activities in Africa.
      
      <b>External regime legitimation</b>
      Research on states' diplomatic outreach – of which high-level diplomatic visits (involving HoSGs and MFAs) are the most visible and relevant part – remains peripheral in political science disciplines. This project aims to develop new datasets on diplomatic outreach and new research related to its role both as an explanatory factor and as an observable manifestation of latent foreign policy/IR/political regimes concepts. Originally conceived to focus on the Horn of Africa​, we have now expanded data coverage to Italy (2000-2022), and the whole of Africa (in progress).I enjoy making things. Here are a selection of projects that I have worked on over the years.

      title: Previous projects
      text: 
      <b>VERSUS ERC project on elite behaviour, leader survival, and conflicts in Africa</b>
      
      VERSUS was a research project of the University of Sussex (Principal Investigator Prof. Clionadh Raleigh) supported by the European Research Council (September 2017-August 2022). VERSUS represents a new direction in political, geographic and empirical subnational studies of conflict and governance. It determines how violence erupts from political processes in varied environments and how common internal and external shocks create new trajectories of governance, violence, and potential for political resilience. My contribution mostly focused on the analysis of Ethiopia's political competition and crises after the rise of Abiy Ahmed. 
      
      <b>Political regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa</b>
      
      Research funded by the Department of Social and Political Science of the University of Milan (February-September 2020) on the evolution of political regimes in Sub-Saharan Africa (book project) and on relations between EU and Africa (policy paper), ahead of the sixth summit between the European Union and the African Union.
      
      <b>Atlante Geopolitico Treccani</b>
      Country profiles and analyses for the 2017, 2018, 2019 editions of the Atlante Geopolitico Treccani.
